## RGSoC Day 3
The last day of the week and the third day of RGSoC was very emotional...
Well ... 
* We forgot to pick up our coach Andrew R. from the metro station :) 
* We laughed, joked and after drinking our coffee, while discussing the daily topics, we had a conversation with our supervisor Lieke :)
* The day continued with some installations, corrections and little troubles with Wi-Fi connection. Despite of everything we continued reading and practicing tutorials.
* Andrew and Tsvety explained us a lot of things.
* One more hour until the end of the day, few more minutes reading and coding...
* Have a nice weekend, see you on Monday :) :) :)
