## Day 4 RGSoC
* After a lot of reading through the weekend we started the new week with a lot of questions.
* Andrew R. was very patient and listened to all of the issues we had.
* He explained us in details everything we've asked him and gave us some tasks.
* So during the day we read for migrations and routes and played with them all over our project.
